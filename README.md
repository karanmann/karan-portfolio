# Karan's Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to start wrapping everything up that I have done the past 8 weeks by building my very own portfolio.

# The problem

This project was challenging for several reasons:

- It had to work in all the most commonly used web browsers.
- It had to work for people that experience disabilities.
- It had to follow strict guidelines and the design created by Jenny Skogvoll at Makeable Sthlm.
- I had to come up with my own content :-)

It is a project that will never be finished since I will need to keep the content updated over time.

The page is built with HTML and CSS, using flexbox for layout, and fully responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop. 
The page looks and functions identically on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. 
It works well for people using screen readers and keyboard navigation.
